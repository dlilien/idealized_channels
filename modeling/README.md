# Run all models

## Initialization
This is multi step, but just this is just to save time/computation and get nicely refined meshes--it should reach steady state in each case

### MISMIP+
First, run mismip_ssa_init.py

Next, run mismip_hybrid_init.py


### Partial stream
MISMIP+ must already be done
Then, run partial_stream_ssa_init.py
Finally, run partial_stream_hybrid_init.py


## Channels

Just run hybrid_channels.py -- it is set up for graceful restarts if you need to do some at a time!
